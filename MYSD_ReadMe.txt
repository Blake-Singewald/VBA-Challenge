This Project is based on reading a large multi column list of stock information over the course of three years. In VBA this code reads and writes several computations such as total volume traded, the total yearly change of the stock price, and a few more things. This code iterates through the three years on three seperate sheets stored in the same workbook. This code was written for a Data Analytics Accredidation Course authored by myself, Blake Singewald.
